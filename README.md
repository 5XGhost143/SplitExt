## Cheat is not working?

**It's most likely that an Game Update changed the Offsets but I made it very easy to get it working again just Clone the Project and enter the new Offsets in [Offsets.cs](https://github.com/5XGhost143/SplitExt/blob/main/Splitgate/Offsets.cs) these Offsets can be dumped or can be found [on Dumpspace](https://dumpspace.spuckwaffel.com) After you enter the new Offsets just build the Project**
